# Ubiquitous Language

_The authoritative, binding vocabulary for one bounded context. Names core domain concepts (aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events) and their relationships. Distinct from the reader-friendly glossary (see `glossary-template.md` and Documentation Handbook §9). Optional — produce for DDD / complex domains._

## Bounded context scope
_Name the context this vocabulary governs and its boundaries._

- Context: <bounded context name>
- Boundaries: <what is in / out of this context>

## Terms
| Term | Meaning | Type (aggregate / entity / value object / domain event) | Relationships |
|---|---|---|---|

## Context map
_How this context relates to neighbouring bounded contexts (customer/supplier, conformist, ACL, etc.)._

| Neighbouring context | Relationship | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <context> | <customer/supplier / conformist / ACL> | <translation rules> |
| <context> | <relationship> | <translation rules> |

## Binding rules
_The rules that keep code and conversation using these terms consistently (renaming, translation at context boundaries)._

- <rule, e.g. renaming policy> — <how it is enforced>
- <rule, e.g. translation at context boundary> — <how it is enforced>
