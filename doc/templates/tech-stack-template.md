# Tech Stack

_Answer not only "what" but "why". Agents use the rationale to stay consistent when proposing new dependencies._

## Languages and runtimes
_Versions, target runtimes, and any required toolchains._
| Language / runtime | Version | Toolchain | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| <language> | <version> | <compiler / SDK> | <what it builds> |
| <runtime> | <version> | <toolchain> | <what it runs> |
## Frameworks and libraries
_Major frameworks/libraries with versions and the role each plays._
| Library / framework | Version | Role |
|---|---|---|
| <library> | <version> | <role, e.g. web framework> |
| <library> | <version> | <role> |
## Datastores
_Databases, caches, queues, object storage — with the data they own._
| Store | Type | Data owned |
|---|---|---|
| <store name> | <db / cache / queue / object storage> | <primary data> |
| <store name> | <type> | <primary data> |
## Infrastructure and DevOps tooling
_Hosting, IaC, CI/CD, container/edge, and deployment tooling._
| Tool | Category | Role |
|---|---|---|
| <tool> | <hosting / IaC / CI-CD / container> | <what it does> |
| <tool> | <category> | <what it does> |
## Observability stack
_Metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and alerting._
| Pillar | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <metrics> | <tool> | <key dashboards / alerts> |
| <logs / traces> | <tool> | <notes> |
## Rationale (why each)
_For each significant choice, record the one-line reason it was chosen._
- <choice> — <one-line reason it was chosen>
- <choice> — <one-line reason it was chosen>
## Alternatives considered (trade-off table)
| Choice | Alternative | Why this one | When to switch |
|---|---|---|---|
## Upgrade and compatibility notes
_Pinned versions, known breaking-change windows, and migration notes._
- <pinned version> — <known breaking-change window>
- <migration note> — <what to do when upgrading>
