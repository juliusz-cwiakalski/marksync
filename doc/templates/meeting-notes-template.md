# Meeting Notes: <topic>

> **Storage rule:** Repo-scoped meetings live in `doc/meetings/` of the implementation repository. Cross-repo, product, or business meetings live in `doc/business/meetings/` of the canonical strategy repository (requires `business_docs_enabled: true`). See `doc/documentation-handbook.md` §2b.

> **Lifecycle:** This document starts as an **agenda** before the meeting and is extended into a **summary** afterward. Update `status` from `Draft` to `Accepted` and `document_classification` from `raw-evidence` to `current-truth` once the summary is finalized.

> **Two ways to share the agenda:**
> - **Copy/paste:** select the "Agenda & Preparation" block below and paste it into the calendar invite.
> - **Git-native:** commit this file (or open a PR) before the meeting and share the file/PR URL as the calendar invite link. Collaborators can comment on the agenda, ask questions, and propose additions before the meeting starts.

> **Transcripts:** Store full transcripts in `doc/meetings/transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.txt` (one click away) and link via `transcript_url` in front matter. Do not inline transcripts — they are large and noisy.

### <topic from agenda>

<notes>

## Decisions

> Record accepted decisions with brief rationale. File significant decisions as ADR/PDR/BDR records and cross-link via `related_decisions`.

- **<decision statement>** — Rationale: <why>. Implication: <what changes>. → <ADR/PDR/BDR-ID if applicable>

## Action Items

> Each item: verb-first task, SINGLE owner, specific due date. Send action items within 60 minutes of meeting end.

- [ ] <action description> — **Owner:** <name> — **Due:** <YYYY-MM-DD> — **Context:** <why it matters>
- [ ] <action description> — **Owner:** <name> — **Due:** <YYYY-MM-DD> — **Context:** <why it matters>

## Ideas

> For brainstorming sessions: capture ALL ideas without judgment during the meeting. Evaluate post-meeting by feasibility x impact. Move accepted ideas to Decisions or Action Items.

- <idea>
- <idea>

**Evaluation (post-meeting):**

| Idea | Feasibility | Impact | Verdict |
|------|------------|--------|---------|
| <idea> | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | <pursue \| park \| drop> |

## Open Questions

> Unresolved items needing follow-up. Assign an owner to investigate each.

- <parked topic> — Proposed next step: <follow-up meeting \| async thread \| add to backlog>
- <parked topic> — Proposed next step: <...>

## Notes Worth Keeping

- <insight, pattern, or constraint discovered>
- <risk identified>
