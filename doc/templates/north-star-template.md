# <Product Name>: North Star

<!-- Strategic pyramid context: this north star sits atop a strategic pyramid —
     mission → vision → strategy → outcome. Mission is what we do today; vision
     is the world if we succeed; strategy is how we get there; the outcome
     (North Star Metric below) is how we measure success. Keep each layer
     consistent; when they conflict, fix the higher layer first. -->

## Vision

<!-- One or two sentences describing the long-term aspirational state.
     What does the world look like if this product is wildly successful?
     Time horizon: 3-5 years. Keep it inspiring but grounded. -->

<"Your vision statement.">

## Mission

<!-- One or two sentences describing what the product does TODAY to move toward the vision.
     Should be actionable, concrete, and customer-focused.
     Format: We <verb> <for whom> by <how>, so that <outcome>. -->

<"Your mission statement.">

## Target Users

<!-- Who is this product for? Be specific — a sharp user definition prevents scope creep.
      Include primary persona and, optionally, one secondary persona.
      Name the role, context, and core need.
      JTBD framing: for the primary persona, state the "job" they hire the product
      for ("When…, I want to…, so I can…") — this is Jobs To Be Done. Use
      persona-jtbd-template.md for the full inception persona+JTBD; use
      persona-template.md / jobs-to-be-done-template.md for business-profile deep dives. -->

- **Primary:** <Role/persona who gets the most value — e.g., "Solo founder who needs to stay focused and energized">
- **Secondary:** <Optional second persona — e.g., "Small product team lead managing releases">

## Problem We Solve

<!-- 3-5 bullet points describing the real pain points that make the target user's life harder.
     These should be pains the user already feels, not features you want to build.
     Each bullet: pain → consequence. -->

- <Pain point 1> — <consequence if unsolved>
- <Pain point 2> — <consequence if unsolved>
- <Pain point 3> — <consequence if unsolved>

## North Star Metric

<!-- The ONE metric that best captures whether users are getting value from the product.
      It should be measurable, leading (not lagging), and tied to the core user action.
      Optionally add 1-2 guardrail metrics to prevent gaming or tunnel vision.
      Outcome, not output: the NSM is the one OUTCOME metric that captures user value
      (a measurable change in user behaviour), not an OUTPUT (features shipped, story
      points). Optimise the outcome; guardrails prevent gaming it. -->

**<Metric name>** — <definition and how it is measured>

Guardrails: <constraints that must not be violated while optimizing the north star metric>

## Guiding Principles

<!-- 4-7 principles that are SPECIFIC to this product.
     Avoid generic platitudes ("user-centric", "data-driven") — every product claims those.
     Good principles create tension and help choose between two reasonable options.
     Format: Principle name → what it means in practice for this product. -->

- **<Principle 1>** — <What it means for decisions in this product>
- **<Principle 2>** — <What it means for decisions in this product>
- **<Principle 3>** — <What it means for decisions in this product>
- **<Principle 4>** — <What it means for decisions in this product>

## Decision Filter

<!-- Prioritization rules that resolve trade-offs. When two good options compete, which wins?
     These should be ordered: higher items override lower items.
     Reference your principles and scope boundaries. -->

When choosing between options, prefer the one that:

1. <Higher-priority criterion> over <lower-priority alternative>
2. <Higher-priority criterion> over <lower-priority alternative>
3. <Higher-priority criterion> over <lower-priority alternative>

## Four-Risk Awareness

<!-- Every major north-star decision is assessed across four risk lenses.
      Capture the top risks so they are not lost; detail them in the registers. -->

Apply the four-risk lenses to the north-star decisions above:

- **Value risk** — will users want this? (does the north star solve a real, felt problem?)
- **Usability risk** — can users use it? (can they reach the outcome the NSM measures?)
- **Feasibility risk** — can we build it? (within our stack, skills, and constraints)
- **Viability risk** — does it make business sense? (sustainable, compliant, affordable)

Track the assumptions and risks behind these in
`assumption-register-template.md` and `risk-register-template.md`.

## Scope

<!-- What is IN scope and what is explicitly OUT of scope.
     Out-of-scope items are things stakeholders might reasonably expect but that you are
     deliberately not doing (now). This prevents drift and avoids debates. -->

**In scope:**

- <Capability or area that IS part of the product>
- <Capability or area that IS part of the product>

**Out of scope (for now):**

- <Capability that is deliberately excluded and why>
- <Capability that is deliberately excluded and why>

## Current Focus

<!-- What the team is building RIGHT NOW. Keep this to the current phase only.
     Link to the full roadmap document for multi-phase planning.
     Update this section when the current focus shifts. -->

<Brief description of what is being built in the current phase and why.>

Key deliverables:

- <Deliverable 1>
- <Deliverable 2>
- <Deliverable 3>

Success criteria for this phase:

- <Measurable outcome 1>
- <Measurable outcome 2>

See [02-roadmap.md](./02-roadmap.md) for the full multi-phase plan.

## Stakeholders

<!-- Who cares about this product and in what capacity?
     Include both human roles and, if relevant, AI agents that consume this document. -->

- **<Role 1>** — <relationship to the product>
- **<Role 2>** — <relationship to the product>
