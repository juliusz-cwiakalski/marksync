# Opportunity Solution Tree

_Conditional — produced when product discovery has been done. Maps a desired outcome to opportunities, solutions, and experiments so engineering scope stays tied to user problems._

## Desired outcome
_The single outcome this tree serves (link to the NSM in `doc/overview/01-north-star.md`). State it as a measurable outcome, not a feature._

- Outcome: <measurable outcome>
- Links to NSM: <north-star metric reference>

    O((Outcome))
    OP1[Opportunity 1]
    OP2[Opportunity 2]
    S11[Solution 1.1]
    S12[Solution 1.2]
    S21[Solution 2.1]
    E111[Experiment 1.1.1]
    O --> OP1 --> S11 --> E111
    O --> OP1 --> S12
    O --> OP2 --> S21
```

## Opportunities
_With evidence/source for each._
| Opportunity | Evidence / source |
|---|---|

## Solutions per opportunity
| Opportunity | Solution | Rationale |
|---|---|---|

## Experiments per solution
_State the assumption tested, the metric, and the stop criteria._
| Solution | Assumption tested | Metric | Stop criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
