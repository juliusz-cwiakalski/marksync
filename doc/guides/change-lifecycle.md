# Change Lifecycle

This guide defines the canonical change workflow for this repository. The PM agent (`@pm`) orchestrates the entire lifecycle, delegating to specialized agents at each phase.

> Part of the [ADOS process map](ados-processes.md) — Change Delivery is the steady-state loop; [Decision Making](decision-making.md) is consulted on demand during artifact creation, and [Documentation Reconciliation](#7-system_spec_update) runs as phase 7.

## Principles

- One ticket = one change.
- The ticket tracker is the source of truth for status.
- Change artifacts live under `doc/changes/` following the Unified Change Convention.
- Local, ephemeral agent state lives under `.ai/local/` and is git-ignored.
- `@pm` focuses on one ticket per conversation unless the user explicitly requests a planning-only session.
- Phases can be reopened: if PM discovers incomplete work in a later phase, PM reopens the relevant phase and delegates to the appropriate agent.

## Required Artifacts (per change)

Inside the change folder `doc/changes/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD--<workItemRef>--<slug>/`:

| Artifact | Purpose | Mandatory |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `chg-<workItemRef>-spec.md` | Canonical specification (problem, goals, AC, DoD) | Yes |
| `chg-<workItemRef>-test-plan.md` | Test strategy and traceability to AC | Yes |
| `chg-<workItemRef>-plan.md` | Phased implementation plan with checklists | Yes |
| `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml` | PM progress tracking, decisions, open questions (git-committed for traceability) | **Yes** |
| `chg-<workItemRef>-notes.md` | Free-form notes, experiments, links | No |

**Optional artifacts (produced when warranted):**

| Artifact | Purpose | When |
|----------|---------|------|
| `doc/decisions/<TYPE>-<zeroPad4>-<slug>.md` | Decision record for a major decision arising during the change | When a hard-to-reverse, precedent-setting, or cross-component decision is needed (typically during specification or delivery) |

## Change Phases (PM-controlled)

Phases are ordered and gated. A phase is not complete unless its artifacts exist and are consistent.

**Key**: Phases can be reopened. If PM discovers incomplete work in a later phase (e.g., `dod_check` finds missing delivery tasks), PM reopens the relevant phase (`delivery`) and delegates to the appropriate agent.

**Legend**:
- Solid arrows: normal forward flow.
- Dashed arrows: feedback loops (phase reopening when gaps are discovered).
- Dashed `decision?` edges: `@decision-advisor` is consulted on demand during artifact creation (0+ decisions per change); precedent-setting decisions become records under `doc/decisions/**`.
- Every phase-reopening (dashed feedback loop) triggers a PM `retro` note in `chg-<ref>-pm-notes.yaml` so each reopened gap becomes process learning.

### 1) clarify_scope

**Owner**: `@pm`

**Goal**: Fully understand the intention of the change and ensure all information is complete before proceeding. This phase aims to minimize late-discovered gaps that would require returning to earlier phases.

**Actions**:

- Read the ticket from the tracker (via MCP).
- **Review current system specification** (`doc/spec/**`) to understand existing behavior, contracts, and constraints relevant to this change.
- Cross-check ticket requirements against system specification:
  - Identify contradictions between requested changes and existing system behavior.
  - Identify dependencies on existing features or contracts.
  - Identify edge cases that may not be addressed in the ticket.
- Analyze requirements for completeness: acceptance criteria, constraints, dependencies, edge cases.
- Identify any gaps, contradictions, or missing key information.
- If issues are found:
  1. Add a comment to the ticket with specific questions (referencing system spec where relevant).
  2. Assign the ticket back to the human owner.
  3. **STOP and wait** for human feedback.
  4. Resume only after feedback is provided.
- Record all open questions, assumptions, and clarifications in `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml`.

**Outcome**: Requirements are complete, unambiguous, and consistent with the current system specification — ready to write the spec, OR ticket is assigned back to human with questions.

**Exit criteria**:

- No blocking open questions remain (all answered by human).
- Requirements are consistent with current system specification.
- PM notes updated with assumptions, clarifications, and relevant system spec references.
- Ticket is assigned to PM (not waiting on human).

### 2) specification

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@spec-writer`

**Goal**: Produce the canonical specification that drives planning and delivery.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` delegates to `@spec-writer` with `workItemRef` and planning summary.
- `@spec-writer` creates or updates `chg-<workItemRef>-spec.md`.
- **Major decisions**: If the spec surfaces a hard-to-reverse, precedent-setting, or cross-component decision, delegate to `@decision-advisor` to produce a decision record (`doc/decisions/<TYPE>-<zeroPad4>-<slug>.md`) before proceeding. Major decisions are best resolved before implementation begins.
- **Minor decisions**: For routine/reversible choices (R0/R1), consult `@decision-advisor` for quick sparring even if no record is produced — the advisor is available throughout the lifecycle, not only for record-worthy decisions.

**Outcome**: A complete spec with problem statement, goals, scope, acceptance criteria, and definition of done.

**Exit criteria**:

- `chg-<workItemRef>-spec.md` exists and is committed.
- Spec is complete enough for test planning and implementation planning.

### 3) test_planning

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@test-plan-writer`

**Goal**: Define verification strategy and traceability to acceptance criteria.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` delegates to `@test-plan-writer` with `workItemRef`.
- `@test-plan-writer` creates or updates `chg-<workItemRef>-test-plan.md`.

**Outcome**: A test plan with test strategy, test cases, and traceability matrix linking tests to AC.

**Exit criteria**:

- `chg-<workItemRef>-test-plan.md` exists and is committed.
- Every acceptance criterion is covered or explicitly marked TODO with an open question.

### 4) delivery_planning

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@plan-writer`

**Goal**: Produce an actionable phased plan for implementation.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` delegates to `@plan-writer` with `workItemRef`.
- `@plan-writer` creates or updates `chg-<workItemRef>-plan.md`.

**Outcome**: A phased implementation plan with check-listable tasks aligned with the spec and test plan.

**Exit criteria**:

- `chg-<workItemRef>-plan.md` exists and is committed.
- Plan is phased, check-listable, and aligns with the spec and test plan.

### 5) dor_check

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@readiness-reviewer`

**Goal**: Adversarially critique the change's spec + test-plan + plan together against the source ticket **and the existing system spec** (`doc/spec/**`) **before** any code is written — the Definition of Ready gate. Catch gaps, contradictions, and unstated assumptions when they are cheap to fix. The gate also verifies the plan lists the system docs to update (`plan_doc_update_coverage`) and the affected code areas — files/modules/classes — per phase (`plan_code_area_coverage`), that the change is consistent with the existing system spec and quality docs (`system_spec_consistency`), and that a clear, testable Definition of Done is defined for this change (`dod_defined`). See [Definition of Ready](definition-of-ready.md).

**Actions**:

- Mark `delivery_planning` as completed and `dor_check` as started in `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml`.
- `@pm` delegates to `@readiness-reviewer` with `workItemRef`.
- `@readiness-reviewer` critiques spec + test-plan + plan vs the ticket under an adversarial stance and emits `READY` or `NOT_READY` (with per-facet findings and a suggested remediation target phase).
- **On `NOT_READY`**: reopen the relevant artifact-creation phase (`specification`, `test_planning`, or `delivery_planning`) — **never `delivery`** — and re-delegate to the matching author agent; re-run `dor_check` until `READY` (max 3 iterations; escalate to human on stalemate).
- **On a surfaced decision needing human input**: STOP and wait.
- Hard gate by default; only an **explicit, recorded override** for a genuinely trivial change may bypass it (no silent skip). The override (`workItemRef`, triviality rationale, human approver, date) is recorded in `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml`.
- Change-scoped decisions go to change docs; system-wide or precedent-setting decisions go to decision records via `@decision-advisor`.

**Outcome**: A `READY` verdict (or a valid trivial override) recorded; the artifacts are validated as a consistent set against the ticket before delivery begins.

**Exit criteria**:

- `@readiness-reviewer` returns `READY` (or a valid trivial-change override is recorded).
- `dor_check` marked completed in `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml`.

### 6) delivery

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@coder`

**Goal**: Implement the change in code according to the plan.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` invokes `@coder` (via `/run-plan <workItemRef> execute all remaining phases no review`).
- `@coder` executes all plan phases, delegating to:
  - `@designer` for UI/UX work
  - `@decision-advisor` for decisions (any type)
  - `@committer` for checkpointing progress
  - `@runner` for heavy command execution (full builds, full test suites)

**Outcome**: All implementation phases in the plan are complete with code changes committed.

**Exit criteria**:

- Plan tasks for implementation phases are complete with evidence (commits, tests, logs).
- All implementation-related checkboxes in the plan are checked.

### 7) system_spec_update

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@doc-syncer`

**Goal**: Ensure repo-level system specs/docs reflect the new truth.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` invokes `@doc-syncer` with `workItemRef`.
- `@doc-syncer` reconciles `doc/spec/**`, `doc/contracts/**`, and other system documentation.
- **Feature spec coverage check:** `@doc-syncer` runs a *positive* coverage check in addition to reconciliation. For each **feature area** the change modifies (a coherent, nameable capability a contributor/reviewer would expect a spec for — i.e., something that warrants a `doc/spec/features/feature-<slug>.md`; the operational definition lives authoritatively in `.opencode/agent/doc-syncer.md`), it looks for the corresponding `doc/spec/features/feature-<slug>.md` and collects any missing feature area into `spec_coverage_gaps` in its structured report. This catches modified capabilities that have *no* spec at all — distinct from reconciliation ("does the existing spec still match?").
- **De-noised, human-gated handoff:** `@doc-syncer` only **reports** `spec_coverage_gaps`; it never creates a spec or a tracker ticket. `@pm` then checks open issues for an existing tracker and **references** it (rather than proposing a duplicate — de-noising), **proposes** a follow-up to the human, and **only the human** approves ticket creation. Coverage is advisory at this phase; it does not block the change from proceeding to `review_fix`.

> **Deferred alternative.** A periodic standalone coverage audit (Proposal C) was considered and is deferred in favor of these inline checks (intake awareness + post-delivery reporting). See change spec GH-78 §7.3.

**Outcome**: System specification is updated and consistent with the implementation; any feature-spec coverage gap is reported (not silently dropped).

**Exit criteria**:

- System docs updated and committed.
- No discrepancies between implementation and documented system state.
- `spec_coverage_gaps` reported (empty when all modified feature areas are covered).

### 8) review_fix

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@reviewer`, then `@coder` for fixes

**Goal**: Ensure the implementation matches the spec and plan.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` invokes `@reviewer` with `workItemRef`.
- `@reviewer` audits code vs. spec/plan, checks test coverage, identifies gaps.
- If reviewer returns `Status=FAIL` or adds remediation tasks:
  - Remediation phase is appended to `chg-<workItemRef>-plan.md`.
  - `@pm` invokes `@coder` (via `/run-plan <workItemRef> execute all remaining phases no review`) to address remediation.
  - Re-run `@reviewer` until `Status=PASS`.

**Outcome**: All review findings addressed; implementation verified against spec.

**Exit criteria**:

- `@reviewer` returns `Status=PASS`.
- No open remediation tasks in the plan.

### 9) quality_gates

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@runner`, then `@fixer` if needed

**Goal**: Ensure builds/tests and repo conventions pass.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` invokes `@runner` to run quality gates per repo conventions (build, test, lint, etc.).
- If failures occur:
  - `@pm` invokes `@fixer` to diagnose and fix.
  - Re-run quality gates until all pass.

**Outcome**: All required checks pass; logs/evidence captured.

**Exit criteria**:

- Build passes.
- Tests pass.
- Lint/format checks pass.
- Any other repo-specific quality gates pass.

### 10) dod_check

**Owner**: `@pm`

**Goal**: Confirm the change is actually done — final acceptance gate.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` performs a checklist review:
  - All phases above completed (check `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml`).
  - All delivery plan tasks complete (all checkboxes checked in `chg-<workItemRef>-plan.md`).
  - All acceptance criteria satisfied (verify against `chg-<workItemRef>-spec.md`).
  - No pending TODOs without an explicit follow-up ticket.
- **If any gap is found**: reopen the appropriate phase and delegate to the relevant agent.
  - Example: if a delivery plan task is incomplete, reopen `delivery` and delegate to `@coder`.

**Outcome**: Full verification that the change meets the Definition of Done.

**Exit criteria**:

- DoD satisfied.
- `chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml` updated with all phases completed.

### 11) pr_creation

**Owner**: `@pm` delegates to `@pr-manager`

**Goal**: Create the PR/MR and hand off to a human reviewer.

**Actions**:

- `@pm` invokes `@pr-manager` to create or update the PR/MR.
- `@pm` assigns the ticket to a human reviewer in the tracker.
- **STOP**: Do not start another ticket automatically.

**Outcome**: PR/MR is ready for human review; ticket is assigned.

**Exit criteria**:

- PR/MR exists and is up to date.
- Ticket is assigned to a human reviewer.
- `@pm` stops and waits for human approval and merge.

## Phase Reopening

Phases are not strictly linear. If PM discovers incomplete work in a later phase, PM can reopen an earlier phase:

Whenever a phase is reopened, `@pm` records a `retro` note in the change's pm-notes (`chg-<ref>-pm-notes.yaml`) — what gap, where discovered, why it was missed earlier, and how to improve. This applies to every feedback loop in the diagram: DoR `NOT_READY`, review remediation, quality-gate fixes, and DoD gaps. Each reopened gap becomes process learning.

| Discovery in... | Gap found | Action |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| `dor_check` | Artifacts not ready (`NOT_READY`) | Reopen `specification`, `test_planning`, or `delivery_planning` (never `delivery`); re-run gate until `READY` |
| `dod_check` | Delivery plan task incomplete | Reopen `delivery`, delegate to `@coder` |
| `dod_check` | AC not satisfied | Reopen `delivery` or `specification` as needed |
| `quality_gates` | Test failure reveals missing implementation | Reopen `delivery`, delegate to `@fixer` or `@coder` |
| `review_fix` | Spec ambiguity discovered | Reopen `clarify_scope` or `specification` |

After addressing the gap, PM continues from the reopened phase through the remaining phases.

## PM Notes Structure (`chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml`)

The PM notes file is **mandatory** for every change. It serves as:
- PM's long-term memory for the change
- Status tracking across sessions
- Traceability via git history

```yaml
change_id: GH-5
title: "Improve PM agent configuration and context storage"
phases:
  clarify_scope: { started: "2026-02-02T10:00:00Z", completed: "2026-02-02T10:30:00Z" }

## Issue Tracker Communication Policy

Use comments as a knowledge base. Comment only when it adds durable value:

- Decisions taken (and rationale)
- Scope changes
- Open questions + answers
- Blockers and investigative findings

Avoid generic status updates. Use tracker state/labels for status.
